Modules: A module refers to a self-contained unit of code that performs a specific set of functions. Modules are designed to encapsulate and organize code into manageable and reusable components. 
        They contribute to the modular programming approach, which emphasizes breaking down a software system into smaller, independent, and interchangeable parts.
